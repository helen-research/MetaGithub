Understanding Open Source Project Dynamics Using the GitHub Event Stream

1. Build D3.js visualizations of project activity over time and other features such as mean time to respond to issues, release frequency, etc. 2. Given a project, use machine learning to determine similar projects and show statistics about them. 3. Use sentiment analysis to determine which languages have projects with the happiest contributors, and predict any features of a bug report that elicit positive/negative responses. 4. Predict projects that are likely to grow over the next year.
